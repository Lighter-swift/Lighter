</h2>

A SwiftPM build plugin that searches for SQLite databases and `.sql` files
within the selected targets, and then generates Swift sources to use those
databases.

The databases can be copied as a resource, but don't have to be. This looks at
all database/SQL files, unless contained in a `NoSQL` directory.

The generated Swift database types are grouped by the stem within a target.
E.g. a target could contain:

  ContactsDB.01.create.sql
  ContactsDB.02.setup-indices.sql
  ContactsDB.03.migrate-to-v3.sql
  ContactsDB.04.migrate-to-v4.sql
  TodosDB.db
  
This will create two Swift database types: `ContactsDB` and `TodosDB`.
Within the group the files are sorted by name and executed in that order to
produces the actual database.

The function can be configured using a `Lighter.json` config file in the
package root.

Alongside this there is the `GenerateCodeForSQLite` command plugin, which can 
manually generate wrapper code into the `Sources/target/dbname.swift` file.

This plugin generates into a derived-data/sources directory used by Xcode or
SPM.

Example use in a SPM target:
```swift
    .target(name         : "ContactsTestDB",
            dependencies : [ "Lighter" ],
            resources    : [ .copy("ContactsDB.sqlite3") ],
            plugins      : [ "Enlighter" ])
```
