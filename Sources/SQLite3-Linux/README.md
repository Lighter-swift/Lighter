</h2>

On Darwin platforms (macOS/iOS/..), SQLite3 is pre-bundled under that name. To
support Linux, we embed this system module.

Usually a module like this is called "CSQLite3", as provided by
ZeeQL: [CSQLite3](https://github.com/ZeeQL/CSQLite3). Using `SQLite3` here for
Darwin compatibility.

The `libsqlite3-dev` package needs to be installed on the Linux system for
compilation.
