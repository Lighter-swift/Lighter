Built by @helje5.

## ZeeZide

Lighter is brought to you by
[Helge Heß](https://github.com/helje5/) via [ZeeZide](https://zeezide.de).
We like feedback, GitHub stars, cool contract work, 
presumably any form of praise you can think of.

## Supporting the Project

If you want to support the project, consider buying a copy of the
[“Code for SQLite3” application](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/code-for-sqlite3/id1638111010).
A macOS app that does the same like the “`swift2sqlite3`” tool, but as an app.
It can be useful to play w/ the Lighter options, but is not required at all.

Thank you!

## Support for Lighter

Commercial support for Lighter is available from [ZeeZide](https://zeezide.de).
Need help to apply that to your codebase, replace slow CoreData or JSON setups
with superfast SQLite? ZeeZide can help with that
[info@zeezide.de](mailto:info@zeezide.de).

Issues with the software can be filed against the public GitHub repository:
